    <h1>What to do or plan when you going paintballing </h1>

    <p> So there is many places were you can go to. I go to on called hollywood sports. what you do when get there you purchase you tickets and then go the rental area to buy paintballs or CO2 tanks. Then after you get all your equipment you go to where they add air into your tanks and see if your paintball guns are in good condition and look good. Then there is a shooting range were you can mark how fast your gun shoots the paintball, and how you can switch the way how fast the gun shoots and how powerful you can change it.<p/>

      <p> When you get your gun tested and ready with all your equipment. you line up and wait for match do begin. while your waiting and they sending you the say open your hopper(the container that holds your paintballs.) They check your paintballs to make sure your not cheating. They check your guns and see if there good, and then they send you off to the battle field. they seperate you into diffrent teams and say team death match or say other things like capture the flag or other things. So yeah then after just have fun :)<p/>
