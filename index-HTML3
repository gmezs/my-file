    <h1>Make sure not to cheat, cause you will get caught!</h1>

    <p> There are many ways to cheat in this game. There is some cheats that you can do and wont get caught and then there is ways that you could. If your a mean person and don't care about the game paintball. well the you could freeze your paintballs and shoot people and make them feel pain all day. well thats one reason you could get caught cause they check your paintballs before you enter the battle field. Then you could do the other cheat which is if you get shot instead of getting out, you wipe the paint off. Thats not a bad cheat, its just a small cheat for you can keep playing and have fun. But if the ref's catch you, you wont get in trouble but they will tell you that your out to go wait till next game starts.

    <h1> What to do when your in the battle field <h1/>

    <p> When your playing, you might get scared or if you done it before you will be happy and ready for the whistle to blow. When the game starts run fast to a hiding place and watch your enemy's and fire back. Try pushing up but move in a good pace and always watch your surroundings to see if you have any enemy's following you or trying to shoot you. In the beginning don't rush in and run straight to your enemy's. that will get you shot and you will lose and have to wait until the next game. But always make sure your having fun thats the best part.<p/>
